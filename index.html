            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Nutrient pollution, specifically nitrate pollution, has been a prevalent environmental issue in America. It measures to be affecting an approximate 15,000 different water bodies and 101,000 miles of rivers and streams in 2012. The major sources of this excess nitrate concentration includes non-point source pollutants such as fertilizer, animal manure, and sewage treatment plants (The Facts about Nutrient Pollution, 2012). If not treated properly, the presence of these nitrates in the water will only increase, further polluting the water.</p>

              <h4 class="info-title">Why should we take action?</h4>
              <p>As mentioned before, neglectful behavior regarding this problem increases it's toxicity and range. As a nutrient, it's presence in water allows various bacteria to thrive, as well as cause algal blooms. This needs to be addressed, as nitrates in the water is capable of imparing several body functions in humans. It is also extremely hazardous to many aquatic life forms, especially pollutant-sensitive ones, such as D. Magna, aquatic crustaceans that are known to be excellent bioindicator organisms in ecotoxicology.</p>

              <h4 class="info-title">Description</h4>
              <p>We observed that various naturally occurring resources were fully capable of acting as a filter between clean water and the pollutants. These materials included sandstone, coconut fiber, and woodchips. Sandstone was capable of filtering surface pollutants, due to their tiny pores being able to hold water like a sponge. Coonut fibers were capable of removing halogens. Woodchips contained bacteria such as Cellulomonas spp (multiple species) and strain WB94 that are capable of removing carbon and nitrates. These naturally occurring processes gave us a way to formulate an efficient 
                solution that does not demand too many resources and is cost and time efficient.

        <p>Our idea goes a long way. We selected several countries around the world. These countries are ones that are known for poor water quality and/or have resources that are used in our filtration design. Reaching to these countries will bring an important use to our product, while simultaneously having enough resources to power it.</p>

              <p>After negatively affecting the environment for all these years, the least we can do as a society is work towards recreation. We strongly hope that after listening to our take on nutrient pollution, that you take initiative towards this cause. <br> <br> If you are ready to make the change, here are a few steps you can take:</p>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Fertilize responsibly.</strong> Control the amount of fertilizer you use, if any. Fertilizer contributes to excess nitrogen pollution when it rains.</li>
                <li><strong>Watch your poo-lution.</strong> Be sure to clean up after your pets if you have them, as animal waste contains excess nitrogen.</li>
                <li><strong>Drive less.</strong> This solution has been recommended for numerous types of pollution, and also applies to nutrient pollution too, as gasoline and other chemicals released during combustion releases nitrogen-containing compounds. Restrict yourself to healthier alternatives, such as biking or walking.</li>
                <li><strong>Donate towards reduction.</strong> Sometimes, money can be the answer. At least towards supporting a cause. You can make your awareness count by donating to companies and charities dedicated towards reducing water pollution. You can make your first donation <a href="https://waterkeeper.org/donate/" target="_blank" style="font-size: inherit; color: inherit"><u>here</u></a>.</li>
